# Kotlin
This project will be a medium to learn kotlin from the basic to advanced how to build an app with kotlin language

## Kotlin introduction
Kotlin is a JVM based language develop by JetBrains that was created with Java developers in mind, 
and with Intellij as its main development IDE.

These are advantages of Kotlin when compared to Java 6:
- More expressive: we can write more with much less code
- Safer: Kotlin is null safe, which means that we deal with possible null situations in compile time, to prevent execution time exceptions. We need to explicitly specify  that an object can be null, and then check its nullity before using it.
- Functional: Not a pure functional language but It uses many concepts from functional programming, such as lambda expressions, to solve some problems in a much easier way. And also the way it deals with collections.
- Extension functions: We can extend any class even if we don’t have access to the source code.
- High interoperable: It’s possible to create mixed project, with both Kotlin and Java files coexisting because the interoperability between both languages is excellent
